You can now easily duplicate a product. You can duplicate multiple products at once. Or, duplicate a single product several times.

== Description ==

If you want an easy way to duplicate WooCommerce products, you have just found it!

**PLEASE NOTE:** you must be using WooCommerce with the plugin.

If you something doesn't work, or you need further help, [use the support desk](https://drift.me/jeanpaul).

If you love the plugin, send some pizza and beer my way: [https://paypal.me/phpdevelopers/18usd](https://paypal.me/phpdevelopers/18usd). (Thank you!)

Note there are three other ways to duplicate products, using this plugin.

1)  Besides the link, you can also tick the checkbox next to a selection of products. Then from "Bulk actions" above the product list, select "Duplicate product." Click "Apply."

2) Another way is to click on the "Edit" link. Then, you should see a box with options to duplicate the product once or multiple times.

3) Yet still, you should see the "Duplicate this product" link in the admin bar when you are editing the product.

Let me know how things go or if you need further assistance.
